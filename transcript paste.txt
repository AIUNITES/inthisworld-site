Orchestrated workflow to resume 3D game development and documentation updates


Let me check what was already created and pick up where it left off.


Investigated filesystem persistence and configuration discrepancies


The previous session's writes didn't persist — the games directory doesn't exist. Let me check project config and permissions, then rebuild everything using MCP.


Scrutinizing available tools for file creation capabilities





Now I have the write tools. Let me make that memory note first, then check existing state.


Inventoried project documentation before constructing game builds


Now let me check the PROGRESS_LOG:


Hunted for missing progress log across project directories






Now let me check transcript directory:


Orchestrated multi-game development workflow and documentation updates systematically






Good — full access to the GitHub directory. Let me build everything with MCP tools. Creating games directory first:


Architected three distinct 3D games using Three.js framework



Now building game 1 — Space Trader:


Pivoted toward procedurally generated exploration game development


Game 2 — World Explorer with procedural terrain:


Pivoted toward arena-style first-person shooter development


Game 3 — Arena FPS:


Architected games hub integration and landing page structure


All three games written. Now let me create a games hub page:


Orchestrated index updates to integrate games section


Now update the main index.html to add Games link and section:


Identified navigation discrepancy and prepared structural modifications

Investigated existing file structure for games section


Let me check if there's already a games section on the page:


Identified and corrected misaligned game file references


There's already a games section from a previous session but with wrong file references. Let me fix:


Prepared to consolidate project files and verify system configurations


Let me check for any orphaned files from the previous session:


Verified file completeness and commenced documentation updates




All files in place. Now update UATEST_PLAN.md:


Reconciled previous session errors and corrected file naming conventions






The UATEST was partially updated from the aborted session but has wrong names. Let me fix it:


Orchestrated progress documentation and project management updates


Now update PROGRESS_LOG.md:


Prepared to document progress across multiple project domains
